# Welcome to WorldCraft!

### What is WorldCraft?
WorldCraft is a fantasy world building tool, envisioned to be the first of its kind. Not only with the ability to create multiple fantasy maps that link together to form a large expansive world using a powerful map editor, WorldCraft will be a hub for a community of fantasy lovers, map-makers and world-builders to design and share unique and inspired fantasy worlds. WorldCraft is designed to be easy to use and accessible to master and novice world-builders alike. 

WorldCraft is a full-stack JavaScript project, with the back end using NodeJS and the front end utilizing ReactJS.

ReactJS : https://reactjs.org/

For a look at what else we use to develop WorldCraft, take a look at the dependencies in package.json.

### Running WorldCraft
WorldCraft uses NodeJS and as such comes installed with the Node Package Manager, or npm. As such, running development versions of WorldCraft will use npm commands. Please follow the link above to download Node on your system before running. Once you download Node, you have just one step left. Before running any commands, please download the dependencies from package.json. This can be done by running

    npm install

in your terminal. See the scripts mentioned below for additional functionality.

#### Scripts
There are a number of scripts available to run on the terminal to interact with the project. They are listed as follows...

##### To run the Voronoi Application
 - npm start

##### To run tests of the application
 - npm test

##### To generate a test coverage report
 - npm run cov-report

##### To run linting analysis
 - npm run lint
 (Or for a more detailed report)
 - npm run lint-detail

### Who can use WorldCraft?
WorldCraft is for everyone! Whether you are just looking to build a fantasy world you've been imagining in your head or you are an experienced world-builder looking for the best tool for making an interconnected world, this is the place for you. The services of WorldCraft will be useful for

 - Fantasy Authors
 - Dungeon Masters
 - Game Developers

As aspiring world-builders ourselves we wanted to build a state of the art application for creating interconnected maps to form larger worlds. We want this to be the application built for world-builders by world-builders.

### Where are we now?
WorldCraft is still in very early development stages. Passion project turned into college senior project, the project is in its infancy, but there is nowhere to go but up. We're dreaming big to bring the best application imaginable to fantasy lovers everywhere. For now, what we have is a the start to an algorithm to generate randomized fantasy maps. We have also done a lot of design work on the side and research into the best way to build our application. We have designed a unique data structure to best contain all of the data that eventually, will relay all of the information about the maps you create in a seamless, easy-to-use format. So while we have made little progress, there is nowhere to go but up.

### Where are we going?
Let me just share some of the goals we aspire to push with this project.

 - To build an online community hub where you can create maps, save maps to the cloud on your account and share your maps with the community or browse other incredible maps made by talented people.
 - Use built in styles on your maps when you generate or draw elements such as mountains, rivers and cities. Or download and use custom styles that you make yourself or get from other talented artists online in the community.
 - Build a desktop and mobile companion app to take WorldCraft with you wherever you go to stay updated with the incredible world-building community.
 - Smart algorithms to handle the generation and placement of elements to create seemingly hand-drawn maps just by submitting a few design preferences in case you want a random map that looks great on the fly.
 - The ability to use a myriad of input devices such as drawing tablets for that increased precision in your designs.
 - Unique and custom hand-drawn designs for every map element imaginable.
 - A great free experience accessible to everybody!

### What are we learning? 
We are learning a great deal about JavaScript in this project as well as tools such as ReactJS. By far, one of the most valuable experiences of having this as a senior project has been being able to develop a full-stack application. The opportunity to work in a team has also proven to be invaluable.
